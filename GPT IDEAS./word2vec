Why Use Word2Vec in This Case?
Word2Vec is useful because it converts sequences (text data) into numerical representations (vectors) that machine learning models can process.
Since machine learning models work with numbers, not raw text, you need some form of feature extraction.

Why Not Just Use the Raw Dataset??
If your dataset contains DNA/protein sequences, feeding raw text directly into a machine learning model won‚Äôt work because models don't understand biological sequences as-is.
Word2Vec helps by:
‚úÖ Capturing sequence relationships (similar sequences have similar vector representations).
‚úÖ Reducing dimensionality (instead of long text, you get a fixed-size vector).
‚úÖ Making it compatible with ML models (as numerical data).
However, Word2Vec alone doesn‚Äôt make a dataset suitable for classification‚Äîyou still need both AMR and non-AMR sequences for supervised learning.

What You Should Do Next?
1Ô∏è‚É£ Ensure your dataset has both AMR (1) and non-AMR (0) sequences.
2Ô∏è‚É£ If all sequences are AMR, you need a dataset with non-AMR sequences to train a classifier.
3Ô∏è‚É£ If you only have AMR sequences, you can use Word2Vec for clustering or similarity analysis instead of classification.
üëâ If you‚Äôre trying to classify sequences as AMR or not, you need to find a dataset with both classes and apply Word2Vec to both before training your model.
