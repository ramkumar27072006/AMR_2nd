# **Step-by-Step Guide: Using Bioinformatics Tools for AMR and Host-Pathogen Studies**

## **1. CARD RGI (Resistance Gene Identifier)**
**Website**: [https://card.mcmaster.ca/analyze/rgi](https://card.mcmaster.ca/analyze/rgi)  

### **Purpose in Your Project**  
- Identifies **antibiotic resistance genes** in bacterial genomes or protein sequences.
- Matches sequences against known **AMR gene databases** (e.g., β-lactamase, efflux pumps).
- Helps in **predicting resistance mechanisms**.

### **How to Use**
1. **Go to CARD RGI** → Click on **Analyze with RGI**.
2. **Upload a FASTA file** containing your bacterial genome/protein sequences.
3. **Choose an analysis mode** (e.g., **"Perfect & Strict"** for high accuracy).
4. **Run the analysis** → The output will provide a list of detected **AMR genes** with confidence scores.

### **Example**
You have an *E. coli* genome. You upload `ecoli_genome.fasta` to RGI. The output might identify the **blaCTX-M** gene, suggesting resistance to β-lactam antibiotics.

## **2. KEGG Pathways**
**Website**: [https://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html](https://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html)  

### **Purpose in Your Project**  
- Maps bacterial and host **biochemical pathways** to see which are affected during infection.
- Helps **identify metabolic pathways** involved in drug resistance.
- Aids in designing **targeted therapeutics**.

### **How to Use**
1. Search for **bacterial pathways** (e.g., *E. coli metabolic pathways*).
2. Use **KEGG Mapper** to check **antibiotic resistance pathways**.
3. Compare with **host pathways** to find overlaps.

### **Example**
- The **β-lactam resistance pathway** in *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* (ko01501) shows how β-lactamase genes contribute to resistance.
- If a bacterial protein interacts with the **host immune system pathway**, you can explore it for **drug target discovery**.

## **3. STRING Database**
**Website**: [https://string-db.org/](https://string-db.org/)  

### **Purpose in Your Project**  
- Identifies **protein-protein interactions (PPI)** between bacterial and human proteins.
- Helps in studying **host-pathogen interactions**.
- Useful for **drug target identification**.

### **How to Use**
1. Search for **a bacterial protein** (e.g., *OmpA* from *E. coli*).
2. Identify **interactions** with host proteins.
3. Download interaction **networks** for visualization.

### **Example**
- If **bacterial virulence factor OmpA** interacts with **human immune receptors**, this could help understand infection mechanisms.
- You can use STRING output to **prioritize drug targets**.

## **4. BLAST (NCBI)**
**Website**: [https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi)  

### **Purpose in Your Project**  
- Compares **bacterial sequences** against known **AMR genes** or **host proteins**.
- Helps find **homologous sequences** in different species.
- Useful for **functional annotation**.

### **How to Use**
1. Upload your **bacterial protein sequence** in FASTA format.
2. Choose **BLASTp** (for protein sequences) or **BLASTn** (for nucleotide sequences).
3. Compare against **NCBI databases**.
4. Identify **similar sequences** and their functional annotations.

### **Example**
- If your bacterial protein **matches a known resistance enzyme**, it confirms its role in **drug resistance**.
- Helps confirm **if an unknown bacterial gene is related to AMR**.

## **5. SwissDock**
**Website**: [https://www.swissdock.ch/](https://www.swissdock.ch/)  

### **Purpose in Your Project**  
- **Performs molecular docking** to predict how drugs bind to bacterial proteins.
- Helps in **antibiotic discovery** by modeling drug-protein interactions.

### **How to Use**
1. **Upload a protein structure** (from AlphaFold or PDB).
2. **Select a drug molecule** to test binding.
3. **Run docking simulation** → See binding affinities.

### **Example**
- If **penicillin binds poorly to mutant β-lactamase**, the bacteria are resistant.
- You can test **new inhibitors** to counter resistance.

### **How to Use**
1. **Upload two protein structures** (bacterial and human).
2. Run **docking simulations** to predict interaction sites.
3. Download results → See **strong interaction sites**.

### **Example**
- If a bacterial toxin binds to a **human immune receptor**, this interaction can be **targeted for therapy**.
