1Ô∏è‚É£ Predicting Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) in Gene Sequences
‚úÖ Plan of Action
Create Dataset from NCBI

Extract gene sequences from NCBI GenBank.
Label them as 0 (Non-AMR) and 1 (AMR).
Use tools like NCBI E-utilities, Biopython to fetch sequences.
Feature Extraction for Gene Sequences

K-mer frequency (nucleotide patterns)
Physicochemical properties (GC content, entropy, melting temp)
Pretrained embeddings (ProtBERT, ESM-2)
TF-IDF weighted k-mers (for statistical importance)
Model Training

CNNs for sequence pattern detection.
Transformers (BERT-based models for biosequences).
Random Forest/SVM for explainability.
Train using datasets with 0 (non-AMR) and 1 (AMR) labels.
Prediction

New input = unknown gene sequence.
Model predicts whether it‚Äôs AMR-resistant or not.
Would you like full dataset creation + model training code?

2Ô∏è‚É£ Predicting Virulence in Protein Sequences
‚úÖ Plan of Action
Create Dataset from UniProt

Extract protein sequences from UniProtKB (Swiss-Prot) Virulence Factor Database (VFDB).
Label sequences as 0 (Non-virulent) and 1 (Virulent).
Feature Engineering

Amino Acid Composition (AAC, Dipeptide, Trigrams)
Physicochemical Properties (pI, Hydrophobicity, Charge)
3D-structure-based Features (Using PyMOL, APBS)
Pretrained embeddings (ESM-2, ProtTrans, TAPE).
Model Training

Train CNNs, LSTMs, Transformers, or XGBoost.
Input: Protein sequence ‚Üí Output: Virulent/Non-virulent.
Prediction

New input = unknown protein sequence.
Model predicts virulent or not.
Would you like full feature extraction + deep learning model implementation?

3Ô∏è‚É£ Web Integration (Combining ML Results, KEGG Pathways, Docking)
‚úÖ Plan of Action
Build Backend API (Flask/Django)

Input: Gene or protein sequence.
Fetch results from trained ML models (AMR + Virulence).
API calls to external services (KEGG, Protein Docking).
Integrate KEGG Pathways

Fetch functional pathways related to predicted proteins.
Link pathways to drug targets.
Protein Docking Integration

Use AutoDock, ClusPro, HDOCK (whichever API is feasible).
Automate docking via Python scripts.
Frontend Web UI (React/Next.js)

User uploads sequence ‚Üí Backend ML model predicts AMR/Virulence.
Show KEGG Pathway related to predicted protein.
Perform Docking (if needed).
Would you like Flask API + React frontend template?

üöÄ Final Execution Plan
‚úÖ Step 1: Implement AMR Model ‚Üí Code + Dataset
‚úÖ Step 2: Implement Virulence Model ‚Üí Code + Dataset
‚úÖ Step 3: Build API & Web UI for integration
